LambTrackerMobile
=================

Android program for managing a sheep flock. Uses both EID and visual tagging to document sheep. 

We are shepherds, programming of this item is happening in modules as we need to do different tasks with the flock during the year.

Currently I set up the database on my desktop system by hand using various SQLite management tools. Then the database is moved to the Android and used there.

As of 2017 All development moved to our GitLab Account. For the latest build go to https://gitlab.com/OogieM/LambTrackerMobile
