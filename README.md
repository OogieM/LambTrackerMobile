=================

Android program for managing a sheep flock. Uses both EID and visual tagging to document sheep. 

We are shepherds, programming of this item is happening in modules as we need to do different tasks with the flock during the year.

We have completed a full year of development as we do tasks with our flock. By and large things are working very well. We are now going back and as we do tasks this year we are updating the program to add the additional features we identified in the first run. 

Current development is focused on improving workflow, expanding the database to handle NSIP EBV data input and output and adapting to more screen sizes and resolutions.

System is based on an SQLite database for all flock data.

Currently I set up the database on my desktop system by hand using various SQLite management tools. Then the database is moved to the Android and used there.

The latest additions are using this to run in Chrome for desktop functions.
