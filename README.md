LambTrackerMobile
=================

Android program for managing a sheep flock. Uses both EID and visual tagging to document sheep. 

We are shepherds, programming of this item is happening in modules as we need to do different tasks with the flock during the year.

We've been running with LambTracker now for 2 years. The pile of potential issues/enhancements is getting larger but most stuff is working well.

System is based on an SQLite database for all flock data.

Currently I set up the database on my desktop system by hand using various SQLite management tools. Then the database is moved to the Android and used there.

The latest additions are using this to run in Chrome for desktop functions.
